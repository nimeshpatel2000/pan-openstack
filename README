Complete set of bootstrap files and heat templates to validate deployment of the Palo Alto Networks VM Series firewall on an Openstack enviroment

Internal Firewall Template

For showing network segementation between two private networks. Traffic is allowed from the pan_trust_net to pan_untrust_net but blocked in the opposite direction. ping from server_trust to server_untrust, will be succesfull. Ping in the opposite direction will fail.

The template performs the following:

1.	Creates security groups for the management interface and traffic interfaces
2.	Creates pan_trust_net and pan_untrust_net networks and subnets
3.	Creates network ports for firewall traffic interfaces, applies "allow_any" security group and static IPs
4.	Creates the firewall instance
5.	Creates a server, server_trust, on the pan_trust_net network
6.	Creates a server, server_untrust on the pan_untrust_net network

Pre-requisites:

1.	The template assumes there is network already created for the management network which has internet access
2.	Appropriate flavor has been created
3.	If you wish to license the firewall, add the licence authcode to the /internal_fw/license/authcodes file.
4.	Edit the config drive file path to one that matches the location of your bootstrap files
5.	Update the /internal_fw/heat/internal_fw_env.yaml file (see below) to match your environment
6.	If the network addresses need to be changed, IP addresses in the bootstrap.xml file need to be changed as well

Environment variables:

  mgmt_network: external
  pan_image: PA-VM-KVM-8.1.0
  pan_flavor: pa.vm.50
  server_image: cirros-0.3.5-x86_64-disk
  server_flavor: m1.tiny
  server_key: npatel

To execute:

cd (path to files)/internal_fw/heat
openstack stack create internal_fw -e internal_fw_env.yaml -t internal_fw.yaml

Basic Gateway Template

For showing internet gateway. Traffic is allowed from pan_trust_net to the external network, but blocked in the opposite dirction. 

The template performs the following:

1.	Creates security groups for the management interface and traffic interfaces
2.	Creates pan_trust_net network and subnet
3.	Creates network ports for firewall traffic interfaces with "allow_any" security group and static IP for the trust side interface
4.	Creates the firewall instance
5.	Creates a server, server_trust, on the pan_trust_net network

Pre-requisites:

1.	The template assumes there is network already created for the management network which has internet access
2.	A network exists for internet access
3.	Appropriate flavor has been created
4.	If you wish to license the firewall, add the licence authcode to the /basic_gw /license/authcodes file.
5.	Edit the config drive file path to one that matches the location of your bootstrap files
6.	Update the /internal_fw/heat/basic_gw_env.yaml file (see below) to match your environment
7.	If the network addresses need to be changed, IP addresses in the bootstrap.xml file need to be changed as well
